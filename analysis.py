#Predicting Star Ratings from Yelp Reviews

##Research Question
'Can the use of positive and negative adjectives in a written Yelp review accurately predict the accompanying star rating for Las Vegas restaurants in 2016?'

##Hypothesis
'Yelp reviews significantly impact businesses by influencing customer perceptions and aiding in reputation management. I hypothesize that the language in written reviews strongly correlates with the star rating, with positive and negative language mirroring customer feelings.'

### I plan to combine the first two datasets to filter restaurants in Las Vegas. Using the business IDs, Iâ€™ll perform a merge to link reviews with businesses, leaving only reviews for Las Vegas restaurants
